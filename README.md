## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Density of States

- **Objective**: Calculate the density of states for a given material, providing insights into the number of electronic states available at each energy level.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Quantum mechanics in solids
  - Band structure and electron occupancy in metals and semiconductors
- **Equations Used**: 
The density of states equation is given by:

```
D(E) = dN(E) / dE
```

Where:
- `D(E)` is the density of states at energy `E`,
- `N(E)` is the number of states below energy `E`,
- `E` is the energy level.

### 2. Electron Drift

- **Objective**: Simulate the motion of electrons in a conductive material under an applied electric field.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Ohm’s law
  - Electron mobility and conductivity
- **Equations Used**: 
Ohm's Law, which relates current density to the electric field, is given by:

```
J = σE
```

Where:
- `J` is the current density,
- `σ` is the electrical conductivity,
- `E` is the applied electric field.

### 3. Frequency Response

- **Objective**: Analyze the frequency response of electrical circuits, focusing on how circuits behave when subjected to different frequencies of input signals.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - AC circuit analysis
  - Resonance, bandwidth, and phase shift
- **Equations Used**: 
The frequency response equation, used to analyze how circuits react to different frequencies, is given by:

```
H(f) = V_out(f) / V_in(f)
```

Where:
- `H(f)` is the frequency response,
- `V_out(f)` is the output voltage at frequency `f`,
- `V_in(f)` is the input voltage at frequency `f`.
